    <h2>DEPRESSION- a invisible health issue</h2>   
        <p>Let’s start my first ever blog😊😊😊 . Today’s topic is “DEPRESSION- a invisible health issue”.



Depression is a serious mental health issue and this is invisible. Everyone try to hide their pains through their smile. But it’s not good thing for your health, it creates a pressure to your brain and makes you down as a hell. The World Health Organization(WHO) describes depression as –“an illness characterized by persistent sadness and a loss of interest in activities that you normally enjoy , accompanied by an inability to carry out daily activities, for at least two weeks.”

Some indicators to identifying the depression –

      Sleeping too much or too little restless sleep, Feeling low, demotivated, alone, hopeless, guilty, anxious etc.
        Losing interest in favorites things that you enjoyed to do in past,
        Losing concentration levels,
        Avoiding friends, family members etc,
        Thinking about death or suicidal thoughts.
If you notice two or more symptoms consistently in your loved💞 ones or your friend👭👫👬, then immediately consult with psychiatrists✅. Always remember that is serious health issue, don’t try to ignore that🙅. Anytime you are feeling low😞, then try to share with your loved one😊. And Meditation is one of the best medicine for depression. It increase your concentration level.

Lastly I conclude that Depression is a curable health issue⛨ and there is no shame to share your problem among people. Just keep yourself healthy ,”Eat healthy and Think Positive”😃😃😃.

Next week I will come with my new Blog. Till then stay tuned💖💖💖.
<br>
THANK YOU .😄
